# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! Here you will find some of the projects I have worked on that showcase my skills in data analytics & data visualizations.

## Projects

## [Project 1: Energy Analysis](./Project1)

### Objective

To determine if overall CO2 emissions are decreasing and its key contributing factors. 

### Description

The project focused on analyzing datasets for CO2 Emissions and Energy Source Production for the years 2013-2023 in the U.S. The datasets included Kilograms (kg) of CO2 Emissions per Megawatthour (MWh) of generation, CO2 emissions (million metric tons), and various energy production sources (Renewables, Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Nuclear & Coal) for every state and the years of analysis. The project involved collecting the data, cleaning it, executing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the trends between the different sources of energy production and CO2 emissions, and drawing up conclusions that are consistent with industry trends.
