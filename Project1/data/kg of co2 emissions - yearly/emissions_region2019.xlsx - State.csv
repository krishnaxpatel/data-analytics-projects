"Notes:
The emissions data presented include total emissions from both electricity generation and the production of useful thermal output.
See Electric Power Annual, Appendix A, Technical Notes, for a description of the sources and methodology used to develop the emissions estimates.
Displayed values of zero may represent small values that round to zero. The Excel version of this table provides additional precision which may be accessed by selecting individual cells.
