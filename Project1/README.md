# Project 1: Energy Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project was to analyze data between CO2 Emissions per MWh Generation and Energy Source Production throughout 2013-2022 in the United States.  

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Datasets: 1. Kg of Carbon Emissions: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/emissions/
             2. Carbon Emissions (million metric tons): https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/
             3. Energy Production (renewables & total energy, fossil fuels & nuclear): https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php#Production
   Tools Used: Spreadsheets, R, SQl
   1. Downloaded all relevant datasets.
   2. Cleared Formatting. 
   3. Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, trimmed whitespaces, removed irrelevant data and outliers.
   4. Formatted data from wide to long for all years and states using tidyr in R **(add code)**
   5. Exported the table to use in SQL. 

3. **Data Processing**:
   1. Created the dataset and tables needed to make my future analysis.
   2. Converted British Thermal Units (btu) to Megawattshour (MWh) **add code**
   3. Selected 
   4. 

4. **Analysis**:
